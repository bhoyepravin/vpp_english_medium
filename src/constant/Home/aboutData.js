    "Our founder Dr. B. S. Moonje made an epoch-making contribution in founding the Central Hindu Military Education Society, our parent body, in the year 1935. He was, then, fired by the desire of Indianization of forces. He was a firm believer in the adage 'MIGHT IS RIGHT'.",
    "He knew that the right path to independence of India was by empowering its youth in mind and body. Thus came into being the Bhonsala Military School, in the year 1937.",
    "The society has a long tradition of past students who joined the Armed Forces, or have rendered commendable service to the society in such diverse fields as politics, civil services, and social service. Our alumni continue to uphold the values and principles instilled by our founder, serving the nation with distinction and honor.",
